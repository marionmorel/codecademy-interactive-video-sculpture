# Interactive Video Sculpture

## Codecademy Project

Let’s get creative with media in p5.js! In this project, we’ll use p5.js to create an interactive video sculpture inspired by the artist Nam June Paik.

[Nam June Paik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nam_June_Paik) (1932 - 2006) was a Korean American artist considered to be the founder of video art. Paik is well known for his video sculptures consisting of found television monitors, where he experimented with ideas about video transmission and manipulation—across an era when video and TV were emerging technologies.

Together, we’ll load and draw videos to create a “sculpture” inspired by the late artist’s work. We don’t have extra TV monitors to spare, but we can simulate them on the canvas using p5.js!
